title: GeoLocation
description: >
  A GeoLocation object represents a geographic location formatted as a *GeoJSON feature*. The format is compatible with RFC 7946, while currently limiting its scope to features of type "Point". Also, the schema defines some optional parameters compatible with the GeoJSON feature *properties* wrapper object.
