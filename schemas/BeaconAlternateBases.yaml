  The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Accepted 
  values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any 
  base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a 
  partially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and 
  last bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless 
  variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take 
  take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any 
  other combination) viable sequences.
  
  Categorical variant queries, e.g. such *not* being represented through 
  sequence & position,  make use of the `variantType` parameter.
  
  Optional: either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
