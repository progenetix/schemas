  start:
    description: |
      Precise start coordinate position, allele locus (0-based, inclusive).
      * start only:
       - for single positions, e.g. the start of a specified sequence alteration where the size is given through the specified alternateBases
       - typical use are queries for SNV and small InDels
       - the use of "start" without an "end" parameter requires the use of "referenceBases"
      * start and end:
       - special use case for exactly determined structural changes

      Precise end coordinate (0-based, exclusive). See start.

    examples:
      - 5556
  startMin:
    description: |
      Minimum start coordinate
      * startMin + startMax + endMin + endMax
       - for querying imprecise positions (e.g. identifying all structural variants starting anywhere between startMin <-> startMax, and ending anywhere between endMin <-> endMax)
       - single or double sided precise matches can be achieved by setting startMin = startMax XOR endMin = endMax

      - 0
      - 6298005

  referenceBases:
    description: |
     Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
     Accepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of 
     any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a 
     partially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and 
     last bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless 
     variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take 
     take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any other 
     combination) viable sequences.
    type: string
    pattern: '^([ACGTN]+)$'
  alternateBases:
    description: |
      The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Accepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and last bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any other combination) viable sequences.

      Symbolic ALT alleles (DEL, INS, DUP, INV, CNV, DUP:TANDEM, DEL:ME,
      INS:ME) will be represented in `variantType`.

      Optional: either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
    type: string
    pattern: '^([ACGTN]+)$'
  variantType:
    description: |
      The `variantType` is used to denote e.g. structural variants.

      Examples:
      * DUP: duplication of sequence following `start`; not necessarily in
      situ
      * DEL: deletion of sequence following `start`
      * BND: breakend, i.e. termination of the allele at position
           `start` or in the `startMin` => `startMax` interval, or fusion
           of the sequence to distant partner


      Optional: either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'DUP'
      - 'DEL'
