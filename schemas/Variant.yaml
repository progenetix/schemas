  _The Progenetix `Variant` represents a non-tracking version of the Beacon
  definition._

  The document describes attributes of the _BeaconGenomicVariant_ object.
  In its current implementation, _BeaconGenomicVariant_ (and related genomic
  objects such as _callset_) represent extended versions of the original,
  VCF-derived GA4GH _variant_ schema.
  
  Compared to the VCF model it was derived from, this schema includes some
  changes:

  * the definition of an optional `end` position, to support e.g. structural
  variants w/o definition of the sequence
  * the use of arrays for `start` and `end` positions, to describe positions
  with uncertain exact location (again, important for structural variants and
  data derived from array based experiments)
      - this corresponds to the use of `CIPOS` and `CIEND` intervals around
      `pos` and `END` positions in VCF, where the begin of e.g. the `pos`
      interval is given by `pos - CIPOS[0]` and the end of the `pos` estimate
      by `pos + CIPOS[0]`
  * an additional 'mateName'
  
  This format may be superseeded or augmented based on current developments in
  the GA4GH::GKS work stream.

  callsetId:
    description: |
      * the identifier ("callset.id") of the callset (i.e. "VCF column") this
      variant is part of

      are nested with the parental object as in a Phenopacket)

  biosampleId:
    description: |
      The optional identifier ("biosample.id") of the biosample this variant was
      reported from. This is a shortcut to variant -> callset -> biosample
      chaining or replaces this in data models w/o separate callset level.

      - description: |
          Mate name (chromosome) for fusion (BND) events; otherwise left empty. 
          Accepting values 1-22, X, Y.
          Compared to the VCF specification, where a fusion is defined from 2 
          BND variants and verbose annotations for describing fusion partners, 
          the use of the `mate_name` attribute allows to treat fusion events as 
          single "variant". Conventions: 
      
          * the lower sorted chromosome (e.g. "8") is annotated for `reference_name` 
          and the higher (e.g. "14") becomes the `mate_name`
          * if a `mate_name` parameter exists, the `end` position refers to this
          * for intrachromosomal events, `mate_name` is identical to 
          `reference_name` and the higher base values are assigned to `end`
        examples:
          - "14"
          - "18"

      `reference_bases` value

      replacements involving the different alleles

  genotype:
    description: |
      * list of strings, using the natural index of the corresponding 
      `alternate_bases` values for the (optionally phased) indication of 
      observed allelic replacements
      * the dot `.` value is used for indicating the reference allele or unknown 
      value
      
      The genotype parameter is largely redundant for single-sample variant 
      annotations in contrast to VCF, where the `alternat_bases` calls have to 
      be indicated for multiple callsets.
