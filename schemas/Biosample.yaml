    In this schema, a "biosample" as the source of the material of a molecular analysis (e.g. genomic array, sequencing), represents the main “biological item” against which molecular variants are referenced.
type: object
required:
  - id
properties:
  id:
    description: |
      The local-unique identifier of this biosample (referenced as
      "biosample_id"). This is unique in the context of the local (e.g.
      server, resource) instance.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'SAMN05324082'
  individual_id:
    description: |
      In a complete data model "individual_id" points to the "id" of the
      individual ("donor", "subjerct"...) this _Biosample_ was derived from.

      In a local context this could be the _id_ attribute in a corresponding
      "individuals" collection.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'SAMN05324082-individual'
  description:
    description: |
      The biosample's description. This attribute contains human readable text.
      The "description" attributes should not contain any structured data.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'Burkitt lymphoma, cell line Namalwa'
  data_use_conditions:
    allof:

      - description: |
          Data use conditions applying to data from this biosample, as ontology object (e.g. DUO).
        examples:
          - id : "DUO:0000004"
            label : "no restriction"
  age_at_collection:
    allof:
      - "$ref": https://schemablocks.org/schemas/sb-phenopackets/v1.0.0/Age.json
      - description: |
          An age object describing the age of the individual this biosample was
          derived from at the time of collection. The Age object allows the encoding
          of the age either as ISO8601 duration or time interval (preferred), or
          as ontology term object.
          See http://build.fhir.org/datatypes
        examples:
          - age: 'P48Y3M'
  biocharacteristics:
    type: array
    items:
      "$ref": ./ExtendedClass.json
    description: |
      "biocharacteristics" represents a wrapper list of "ExtendedClass" objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the biosample.
      Examples would be phenotypes, disease codes or other ontology classes specific to this biosample. In a complete data model (variants - (callsets) - biosamples - individuals), characteristics applying to the individual (e.g. sex, most phenotypes) should be annotated there.
    examples:
      - - description: "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
          type :
            id : "icdot:C25.9"
            label : "Pancreas, NOS"
        - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
          type:

            label : "Adenocarcinoma, NOS"
        - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
          type :

            label : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
  external_references:
    type: array
    items:
      "$ref": ./ExtendedClass.json
    description: |
      list of reference_class objects with properly (e.g. identifiers.org) 
      prefixed external identifiers and a term describing the relationship
    examples:
