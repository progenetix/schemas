   "description" : "Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`). \nAccepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the \nposition of any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any \ntype or within a partially known sequence. For example a sequence \nwhere the first and last bases are known, but the middle portion can \nexhibit countless variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: \nANNT the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT \nand ATGT (or any other combination) viable sequences.\n",
